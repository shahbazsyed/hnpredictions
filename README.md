# LLM's Review of Human Predictions for 2025
Predictions are an annual tradition on Hacker News. I was curious what do some of the current LLMs think about what we predict about 2025.

This silly project is a web app that filters comments, extracts predictions, evaluates them by their likelihood of happening, and organizes them by themes.

The original discussion can be found here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42490343

At the time of running this project, the original discussion has 550 comments from which these predictions were extracted by the LLMs. Each LLM differs in the comments it considers relevant for further evaluation, thus the variation in statistics. 


## Features

- View predictions from multiple AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4)
- Filter predictions by confidence level (Likely, Maybe, Unlikely)
- Organized by themes for easy navigation
- Responsive design with Bulma CSS framework

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. No server setup required - all data is loaded from static JSON files
